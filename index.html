<h1><b>The Merchant Of Venice</b></h1>
<p class="zero"> 
    <img src="download.png" alt="image">
 The Merchant of Venice* contains some of Shakespeare’s most memorable and complex characters. While Antonio is central to this play — after all, he is normally considered the person for whom it is named — audiences are inevitably fascinated by Shylock, the Jew who sues Antonio for a lethal “pound of flesh” in return for unpaid loans, and by Portia, the wealthy heiress, who marries Antonio’s friend Bassanio and saves Antonio’s life in a dramatic courtroom scene.

    <h4><b>ANTONIO</b></h4>
    <p class="two"> In sooth, I know not why I am so sad. <br>
        It wearies me; you say it wearies you. <br>
        But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, <br>
        What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born, <br>
        I am to learn. <br>
        And such a want-wit sadness makes of me, <br>
        That I have much ado to know myself.</p>
     <h5>SALARINO</h5>
     <p class="three">Your mind is tossing on the ocean, <br>
        There, where your argosies with portly sail, <br>
        Like signors and rich burghers on the flood— <br>
        Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea— <br>
        Do overpeer the petty traffickers <br>
        That curtsy to them, do them reverence <br>
        As they fly by them with their woven wings.</p>
     <h6>SALANIO</h6>
     <p class="four">Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, <br>
        The better part of my affections would <br>
        Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still <br>
        Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind, <br>
        Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads. <br>
        And every object that might make me  <br>
        Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt <br>
        Would make me sad.</p>
